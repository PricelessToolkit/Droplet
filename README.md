## First time setup

### WIFI Captive Portal

The captive portal component in ESPHome is a fallback mechanism for when connecting to the configured WiFi fails.
After 1 minute of unsuccessful WiFi connection attempts, the ESP will start a WiFi hotspot with the credentials
```
SSID: "Droplet Fallback Hotspot"
password: "password"
```

When you connect to the fallback network, the web interface should open automatically (see also login to network notifications).
If that does not work, you can also navigate to http://192.168.4.1/ manually in your browser.
In this web interface, you can manually override the WiFi settings of the device.
Additionally, you can upload a new firmware file to your node without having to use a USB cable for uploads.

### Reflashing via USB-UART adapter

First, you need to create in the ESPhome new device using the Droplet Config file "don't forget to change it to your needs" then compile it and download the ".bin" file. To upload it to the Droplet, we also need  "ESPHome Flasher" software

* Connect your USB-UART adapter to the Droplet Mainboard "GND, 3.3V, TX, RX"
* 
  ![HA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PricelessToolkit/Droplet/main/img/prog_header.jpg)
  
* Push the "PROG" button on the Droplet Mainboard "Don't release it"
* Plug the USB-UART adapter to the PC.
* Upload firmware via ESPHome Flasher.
* Release the "PROG" button.
 



## Setting the onboard DS18b20 temperature sensor

First of all we need to find out the address of the Onboard temperature sensor.
For example with this configuration: "which is already in the default config"

```
one_wire: #https://esphome.io/components/one_wire
  - platform: gpio
    pin: GPIO25
```

In the log output (ensure the log level is set to at least debug), youâ€™ll see something like this.


<img src="https://esphome.io/_images/dallas-log.png" width="634" height="321" />


With the temperature sensor address identified in the log, we can now enable the Display component by uncomenting  this line.

```yaml
it.printf(5, 15, id(font3) ,"%.1fÂ°C", id(intergratedtmp).state);
```

It should look like this in the full configuration.

```yaml
display: # More info https://esphome.io/components/display/ssd1306.html?highlight=1306         
- platform: ssd1306_i2c
  id: oled
  model: SSD1306 128x64
  address: 0x3C   # Oled Display Address
  lambda: |-
    it.printf(2, 0, id(font2), TextAlign::TOP_LEFT, "DROPLET");
    it.printf(61, 0, id(font2) ,"%.1f", id(dbm).state);
    it.line(0, 12, 98, 12);
    it.line(98, 0, 98, 64);
    it.printf(102, 0, id(font2) ,"%.1f", id(Soil1).state);
    it.printf(102, 12, id(font2) ,"%.1f", id(Soil2).state);
    it.printf(102, 24, id(font2) ,"%.1f", id(Soil3).state);
    it.printf(102, 36, id(font2) ,"%.1f", id(Soil4).state);
    it.printf(102, 48, id(font2) ,"%.1f", id(Soil5).state);
    it.printf(5, 15, id(font3) ,"%.1fÂ°C", id(intergratedtmp).state);
#   it.printf(5, 30, id(font3) ,"%.1fH", id(dhthumidity).state);
#   it.printf(5, 45, id(font3) ,"%.1fP", id(pressure).state);

```

Now, uncomment the integrated temperature sensor configuration and add the address.

```
  - platform: dallas_temp
    address: 0x6e3c......
    name: "${name} Integrated TMP"
    id: "intergratedtmp"
```
After adding it to the configuration, reinstall the firmware once more.
