## First time setup

### WIFI Captive Portal

The captive portal component in ESPHome is a fallback mechanism for when connecting to the configured WiFi fails.
After 1 minute of unsuccessful WiFi connection attempts, the ESP will start a WiFi hotspot with the credentials
```
SSID: "Droplet Fallback Hotspot"
password: "password"
```

When you connect to the fallback network, the web interface should open automatically (see also login to network notifications).
If that does not work, you can also navigate to http://192.168.4.1/ manually in your browser.
In this web interface, you can manually override the WiFi settings of the device.
Additionally, you can upload a new firmware file to your node without having to use a USB cable for uploads.

### Reflashing via USB-UART adapter

First, you need to create in the ESPhome new device using the Droplet Config file "don't forget to change it to your needs" then compile it and download the ".bin" file. To upload it to the Droplet, we also need  "ESPHome Flasher" software

* Connect your USB-UART adapter to your PC
* Push the "PROG" button on the Droplet Mainboard "don't release it"
* Plug the power adapter and wait for a second, then release the button
* Connect your USB-UART cables TX, RX, and GND to "J1"
* Upload firmware via ESPHome Flasher
 



## Setting the onboard DS18b20 temperature sensor

First of all we need to find out the address of the Onboard temperature sensor.
For example with this configuration: "which is already in the default config"

```
dallas:  # Integrated Temperature Sensor. https://esphome.io/components/sensor/dallas.html
  - pin: 25
    update_interval: 5s
```

In the log output (the log level must be set to at least debug!) you will find something like this


<img src="https://esphome.io/_images/dallas-log.png" width="634" height="321" />


Now that we know the address of temperature sensor, we can add it to the config as an example shown below

```
sensor:
  - platform: dallas
    address: 0xA40000031F055028
    name: "Droplet Onboard TMP Sensor"
```
after adding it to the config "install" the new firmware one more time.
